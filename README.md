# World-Layoff-SQL

Project Overview:

This project aims to explore and analyze global layoff patterns using a dataset containing information about companies, locations, industries, and layoff details. By applying SQL data cleaning and exploratory data analysis techniques, we aim to uncover insights into the factors influencing layoffs and identify trends in the job market.

1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
   
The initial phase of the project involved cleaning and preparing the raw data for analysis.

Key steps included:
* Handling duplicates: Identifying and removing duplicate records to ensure data accuracy.
* Data standardization: Cleaning and standardizing text data (e.g., company names, industries) for consistency.
* Null value treatment: Addressing missing values in critical columns to maintain data integrity.
* Data type conversion: Ensuring correct data types for columns (e.g., converting date strings to date format).

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   
After data cleaning, exploratory data analysis was conducted to uncover patterns and trends:

* Layoff magnitude: Identified companies with the highest total layoffs and layoff percentages.
* Layoff distribution: Analyzed layoffs by industry, country, and year to understand distribution patterns.
* Time-series analysis: Explored layoff trends over time, including monthly and yearly breakdowns.
* Company-level analysis: Identified companies with consistent high layoff rates and analyzed their characteristics.
